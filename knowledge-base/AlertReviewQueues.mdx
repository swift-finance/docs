Alert Queues allow you to streamline and manage alerts effectively, providing a system for tracking issues based on rules or risk levels. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Alert Queues, assigning alerts, and using them to manage a manual review process.â€‹

## How to Create and Configure an Alert Queue
Alert queue can be configured based on rule or risk level. Please refer below for step-by-step instruction. Please refer to Rule Editor Guide If you need to create a new rule.


## Queue Types
Swift's Alert Review Queues provide a powerful system for managing and triaging potential fraud alerts and risk signals. This guide explains how to effectively configure and utilize queues to streamline your fraud review process.

## Overview
Alert Review Queues help financial institutions:
- Organize alerts based on risk level and type
- Prioritize high-risk cases for manual review
- Track review status and outcomes
- Maintain audit trails of decisions
- Distribute workload across fraud teams

## Queue Categories
Swift supports several queue categories to help organize alerts effectively:

### Transaction-Based Queues
- **Individual Transactions**: Review specific high-risk transactions
- **Session Activity**: Analyze user session behavior patterns
- **Payment Flows**: Monitor payment and transfer activities

### Customer-Centric Queues  
- **Customer Profile**: Aggregate alerts by customer for holistic review
- **Device Analysis**: Track suspicious device patterns
- **Business Accounts**: Monitor commercial account activity

### Specialized Queues
- **Recipient Analysis**: Review patterns related to payment recipients
- **High-Value Transactions**: Separate queue for large value transfers
- **Custom Categories**: Create custom queues based on your needs

## Queue Configuration

### Setting Up a New Queue
1. Navigate to Queue Management in your Swift dashboard
2. Click "Create New Queue"
3. Select queue type and category
4. Configure routing rules and risk thresholds
5. Assign team members and permissions
6. Set SLA and priority levels

### Routing Rules
There are four ways to enqueue an entity (session, customer, device, or transaction) into a review queue:

### 1. Real-time Routing
Entities are automatically routed to queues in real-time based on configured rules and triggers.

### 2. Rule-Based Evaluation 
When a rule's conditions are met, the matching entity is added to the specified queue. Note that rules must be active (not in shadow mode).

### 3. Risk Level Thresholds
Entities are automatically queued when they meet defined risk level thresholds. For example, all transactions with "high" risk scores.

### 4. Manual Addition
Analysts can manually add entities to queues while reviewing sessions through the dashboard interface.

Additionally, Swift runs routine batch monitoring to analyze historical transactions and may add entities to review queues based on pattern detection.

### Routing Rules

Define how alerts are routed to specific queues:
- Risk score thresholds
- Transaction amount ranges
- Customer segments
- Geographic regions
- Custom rule combinations

### Team Management
- Assign reviewers to specific queues
- Set workload distribution rules
- Configure backup reviewers
- Set working hours and coverage

## Working with Queues

### Alert Review Process
1. Alerts are automatically routed based on rules
2. Reviewers see prioritized cases in their queue
3. Each alert contains relevant context and data
4. Decisions and notes are logged for audit
5. Cases can be escalated or reassigned

### Queue Analytics
Monitor queue performance with metrics like:
- Average resolution time
- Queue volumes and trends
- False positive rates
- Reviewer productivity
- Risk detection accuracy
