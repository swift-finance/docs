# Swift Sandbox Environment

Our sandbox environment allows you to test Swift's deposit analytics and fraud detection capabilities in a safe, simulated environment before integrating with your production systems.

## Getting Started

1. Request sandbox credentials by emailing [onboarding@joinswift.app](mailto:onboarding@joinswift.app)
2. You'll receive API keys and access to the sandbox dashboard
3. Use the sandbox API endpoints with your test data

## Simulated Data Feeds

The sandbox provides realistic simulated data streams that mirror production scenarios.

## Example Sandbox Transaction and Risk Score Fetch

This sandbox code POSTs to the account activity feed and fetches the risk score for a customer.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.sandbox.joinswift.app/v1/customer/account/activity"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>"
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={
    "customer_id": "1234567890",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2024-01-31",
    "activity_type": "login_attempt"
})

url = "https://api.sandbox.joinswift.app/v1/customer/fraud/risk-score"
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json()["risk_score"])

```


### Account Activity Feed

The sandbox simulates typical account activity patterns including:

- Account openings and closures
- Balance changes and transfers
- Login events and session data
- Profile updates
- Card activations
- Service enrollments

### Fraud Event Feed

The sandbox generates synthetic fraud scenarios such as:

- Account takeover attempts
- Suspicious login patterns
- Unusual device fingerprints
- High-risk transactions
- Known fraud patterns
- Synthetic identity markers

### Customer Interaction Feed

The sandbox provides simulated customer interaction data including:

- Support ticket creation
- Chat transcripts
- Dispute filings
- Document uploads
- Password resets
- Contact information changes

### Deposit Analytics Feed

Our deposit analytics sandbox generates synthetic transaction data that simulates real-world deposit patterns, including:

- Regular payroll deposits
- Large wire transfers
- ACH transactions
- Mobile check deposits
- Cash deposits
- International transfers

The feed includes metadata like:

- Account identifiers
- Transaction amounts
- Transaction types
