## Production Integration Overview

Swift's production integration process is designed to be seamless while ensuring robust security and optimal performance. Our experienced solutions team will guide you through each step, from initial assessment to full deployment.

## Key Integration Components

### Data Ingestion
Swift can ingest data through multiple channels:
- Real-time API feeds
- Batch file uploads
- Database replication
- Event streaming (Kafka/Kinesis)
- Webhook notifications

### Authentication & Security
We support industry-standard security protocols:
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Mutual TLS (mTLS)
- API key authentication
- IP whitelisting
- End-to-end encryption

### API Integration Options
Choose the integration pattern that best fits your needs:
- RESTful APIs for core functionality
- GraphQL for flexible data queries
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Webhook notifications for event-driven architectures

### Dashboard Access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) support
- Custom user permissions
- Audit logging

## Integration Timeline

A typical production integration takes 4-8 weeks depending on complexity:

Week 1-2:
- Technical discovery sessions
- Architecture design
- Security review
- Data mapping

Week 3-4:
- API integration development
- Data pipeline setup
- Dashboard customization
- Initial testing

Week 5-6:
- UAT environment setup
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Staff training

Week 7-8:
- Production environment setup
- Gradual traffic migration
- Monitoring configuration
- Go-live support
