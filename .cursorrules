This project is mock documentation I'm using to pitch a new product to a team.

The document is written in markdown and uses mintlify to generate the website.

The document describes a product called Swift with the following synposis:
“Swift provides AI-powered analytics to financial institutions. Our platform helps 
analyze deposit trends and detect account fraud using advanced machine learning models 
and LLMs. We focus on transforming data into high-quality insights to improve 
operational efficiency and customer experience.”

The main features of the product are:
- Deposit analytics
- Account fraud detection
- Data transformation
- Insights generation

The product is aimed at financial institutions and the target audience is the CTO or equivalent.
